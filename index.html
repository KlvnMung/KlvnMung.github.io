    <h1>Hello world</h1>
    <p>This is a file in a git repo</p>
    <p>Repositories store various version changes of our code</p>
    <p>To initialize a repo use <strong>git init</strong> in the file you would like to track changed</p>
    <pre>
        Before initializing one would like to key in credentials.
        What this does is that it tracks who made the changes in 
        a team working on similar project.To do this use <command>
        git config --global user.name "Your name"</command> redo 
        and  replace name with email.To keep track of a single 
        project remove global keyword and it will only track the
        current folder git was initialized in.
    </pre>

    <pre>
        For every new file that is added in our working directory 
        is untracked,in order for git to be aware of the file changes
        we need to stage it.
    </pre>
    <p>A new line in our file!</p>

    <p>This line is here to show how merging works.</p>
